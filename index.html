    <h1>Projected Coronavirus Deaths in the USA by Month</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This interactive slideshow visualizes the total predicted deaths in the USA due to Covid-19 over time. Each step in the slide show will take you
        to the next projection date (usually about a month in advance). What you will be able to see is how the projections
        of Coronavirus deaths have changed as time continues, and how they continue to exceed projections.
    </p>

    <h3>Reading the Graph</h3>
    <p>
        The primary focus of this visualization is the blue line, which represents projected deaths from Covid-19 by month, where 
        the x-axis corresponds to the date and the y-axis corresponds to the total amount of deaths. The light blue area that 
        surrounds the line represents a confidence interval, denoting the extremes that the prediction could exist between.
    </p>
    <p>
        One important visual element of the graph is the dashed vertical line, which represents the date where the data 
        starts being a prediction. Every date before the line is the actual data (meaning the actual number of deaths that occured), 
        and everything after the line are predictions. You'll also notice that this is where the confidence interval begins, which 
        makes sense because it is where the predictions begin. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The next element you'll notice is a dashed horizontal line, which will specify the maximum number of deaths that have
        been predicted at the specified date of projections. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You also have the ability to filter down by state for a given projection data set. This will allow you to look at the 
        data for a specific state, as opposed to the country as a whole. Furthermore, you can hover over the line and get a specific 
        number of deaths according to a specific date, depending on where you mouse over.
    </p>
    <p>
        To advance to the next (or previous slide, if applicable), simply click the arrow buttons to load the next projection. The
        current line of projection will remain on the graph in gray, in addition to the max deaths line for that projection, in order
        for you to compare the changes over time. Every other element of the chart will update to the latest projection data.
    </p>
